# DataExporter
Beta Version

1-Select up to 5 elements and then click "select properties", then, select the properties thet you will export later.

2-Select the elements to be exported (Will export only the properties you selected before)

3-Filter or hide columns if needed

4-Export to CSV

Point 2 is critical, what you select is what you get...
Many other filters can be implemented, even an excel like filter, (http://objectlistview.sourceforge.net/cs/filtering.html#column-filtering-label), but as documentation explains:
"Filtering and TreeListViews interact in a predictable but perhaps unexpected fashion.
Filtering considers only rows that are currently exposed (that is, all their ancestorss are expanded)."

Use the plugin at your own risk
